The test strategy is to type only a combination of file lists and folders on the command line to check whether all files can be listed in sequence. Test the command line parameters to make sure that all the object files can be enumerated. After entering different combinations of command-line arguments, we check to see if each argument is parsed correctly. After making sure that the command parameters can be parsed correctly, I can use them in the program logic.
